                        BitTorrent Sync

BitTorrent Sync lets you sync and share an unlimited number of files
and folders across all of your trusted devices.

How to start Sync
-----------------

After extracting this tarball, just run:

  $ ./btsync

to start the Sync daemon.
Then go to localhost:8888 in a web browser to access the WebUI.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
To improve security, the LAN listening interface is off unless you configure it.
By default the WebUI is only accessible on the computer running Sync
(localhost:8888). In order to have the WebUI accessible across the
LAN, use a configuration file or start Sync this way:

  $ ./btsync --webui.listen 0.0.0.0:8888


Some useful options
-------------------

--config <path to configuration file>
		 Use a configuration file.

--dump-sample-config
		Print an example configuration file.

--nodaemon
